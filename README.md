:rocket: This project is powered by [textual](https://github.com/willmcgugan/textual) and [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)!

## Installation and Configuration

`jenkins-tui` is available on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)!

```bash
pip install jenkins-tui
```

Once the app is installed you can run it from your terminal with the `jenkins` command.

```bash
jenkins
```

Alternatively, you can run the app with docker to keep your local dependencies squeaky clean ðŸ§¹

```bash
docker run --rm -it --volume $HOME:/jenkins ghcr.io/chelnak/jenkins-tui:latest
```

### Configuration

On first run you will be asked for some information so that the app can build your configuration file.

You'll need to enter a **url** for your Jenkins instance along with a **username** and **password**.

Alternatively you can manually pre-load a config file at `~/.jenkins-tui.toml` and use the following schema:

```bash
# .jenkins-tui.toml

url = ""
username = ""
password = ""
```
